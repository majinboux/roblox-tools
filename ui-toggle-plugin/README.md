## 🔧 How It Works

The script automatically creates these config files:

1. **ClientAppSettings.json** - Enables ribbon customization
2. **StudioRibbonConfig.json** - Defines your classic toolbar layout

Then you just use Roblox Studio's built-in **"Reload custom tabs"** feature to apply it.

**No hacks, no registry edits - 100% official Roblox features!**

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will this break my Studio?**  
A: No! It uses Roblox's official customization system. The script even creates backups.

**Q: Will my layout save?**  
A: Yes! Roblox Studio remembers your ribbon customization automatically.

**Q: Can I go back to Next Gen UI?**  
A: Yes! Just use Add Tools → Reload custom tabs again, or delete the config files.
